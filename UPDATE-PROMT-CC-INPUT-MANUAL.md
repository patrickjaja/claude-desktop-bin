/go check @update-prompt.md it describes how you should automatically download the latest         
official .exe and build the project locally. then check if it can still be built for linux and    
work on patches if needed. at the end it might be interessting if you can check for new things    
we need to make compatible, normally patterns are like if platform = darwin or win32 or similar.  
This is the goal of this project, to make that compatible for linux
